**PROJECT LINK:** https://ray-b-ouamba.github.io/WEBSITE-BACKGROUND-COLOR-COLOR-ALTERNATION-/

## HOW IT'S MADE:

**TECH USED:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## OPTIMIZATIONS

Our webpage is intended to require a background color change every 20 seconds. Rather than selecting colors at random, we might apply a predetermined color scheme to our background. Thus, it will always select the precise color we have selected for the project whenever it changes.

## LESSONS LEARNED:
Discover how to use the Math.random() and setTimeout() methods.
